/**
 * \ingroup congestionOps
 *
 * \brief An implementation of TCP Adaptive Reno+.
 *
 * Westwood+ employ the AIAD (Additive Increase/Adaptive Decrease)
 * congestion control paradigm. When a congestion episode happens,
 * instead of halving the cwnd, these protocols try to estimate the network's
 * bandwidth and use the estimated value to adjust the cwnd.
 * While Westwood performs the bandwidth sampling every ACK reception,
 * Westwood+ samples the bandwidth every RTT.
 *
 * The two main methods in the implementation are the CountAck (const TCPHeader&)
 * and the EstimateBW (int, const, Time). The CountAck method calculates
 * the number of acknowledged segments on the receipt of an ACK.
 * The EstimateBW estimates the bandwidth based on the value returned by CountAck
 * and the sampling interval (last RTT).
 *
 * WARNING: this TCP model lacks validation and regression tests; use with caution.
